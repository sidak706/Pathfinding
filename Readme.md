Run the code in main.py to see the visualisation of Djikstra's PathFinding Algorithm. 

The Blue and Orange cells represent source and target respectively. Black cells represent walls. Jumping over walls is illegal. Additionally, the code cannot traverse diagonally. 

Entering space will begin the algorithm. Once the shortest path is found (if any), it will be highlighted in Purple.


The algorithm has also been implented in Java however the GUI is only available in the Python version. 

More algorithms will be added soon.
